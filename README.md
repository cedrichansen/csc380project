GAME DESCRIPTION

Our version would be a desktop application. Players will connect to a "host" using
a unique passphrase or code.

The opening screen will consist of two buttons: "Create Game" and "Join Game"
if we have time at the end, we will add an option "Create your Own Questions"

Selecting "Create Game" will take you to a new screen where you can view/edit the room
name, view the active players, select a pre-made question pack, and begin the
game

Selecting "Join Game" will take players to a new screen where they will input the
host's code and enter

When you first connect to the server you will create a username that is stored
for each game on the server. If you leave the "room", your username is saved
when you return.
